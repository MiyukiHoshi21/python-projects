Hi guys! ヾ(＾∇＾)

The Feel Better Bot is like something for fun and it kinda sucks. （◞‸◟）

Check out The Impossible Test. （＾ω＾）

If you can get a positive score without checking the answers, I clap for you genius. (☆▽☆)

If you don't, don't worry, there's a reason why it's called The Impossible Test. (・ω<)

If I happen to be bored after the EOYs I might add to the test like put some History questions and stuff. ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
